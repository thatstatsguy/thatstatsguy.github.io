Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm Chris. This site is a collection of information about my work, my ideas and the journey to being a better software engineer. When not in front of a keyboard, you can find me on a wine farm or up in the mountains.

My goal for 2023 is to write a lot of (hopefully) useful tech content on my [blog](https://thatstatsguy.github.io/blog/). Feel free to take a look while you're here!
