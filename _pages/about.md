Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm Chris. This site is a collection of information about my work, my ideas and the journey to being a better software engineer.

I learn best when explaining concepts to others. My blog is an effort to document what I've learned and share it with you. As developers we stand on the shoulders of giants and I hope that these articles will help you in some small way. Most articles I write have an accompanying code sample so take a look at my [TIL (Today I Learned)](https://github.com/thatstatsguy/til) repo if for whatever reason I've forgotten to attach something to the article.

When not in front of a keyboard, you can find me on a wine farm or trail running up in the mountains!
